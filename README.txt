This is a repository of coding projects in C im doing on the side apart from college classes.
Im also using this repository to learn how to use Github, mainly in VSCode.

My end goal is to make loads of small projects, a few medium sized ones and finally a big project where I can use all the tools and skills I've learnt for C.
