Small project I made in a day.

The clock was very simple and easy to implement as soon as I had an idea on how to do it.

Stopwatch in C, this one took a couple hours to get right and to a place I felt was good enough. Biggest problem I faced was pausing and resuming the stopwatch... mainly because I did not know the function 'pausedTime' existed in the time.h libary, but hey the main reason Im doing these small projects is to learn, so this project has been very valuable.
